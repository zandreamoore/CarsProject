# CarsProject
These test cases include both a Valid and Invalid Conditions
Valid Condition - 'Verify user can enter zip code and select 50 mileage and generate expected results'
Invalid Condition - 'Verify user cannot enter 6 numerical values for the zip code'
I chose to use Cypress to automate these test cases because of the ease of use and its readable language

One challenge I faced was removing the errors caused by the application CARS.com
Although this site threw back errors, I was still able to automate both tests

Project Execution:
  1) Install Cypress
  2) npm install cypress --save-dev
  3) Run Test - cars.js
